Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        
Your project is configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- receive_sharing_intent requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- shared_preferences_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- url_launcher_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /home/uetaka/dev/stackdock-v1/read_it_later/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
        ...
    }

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
